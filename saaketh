Devops is a culture / Software developement approach , which involves continueosly combing the code , continueosly testing the code ,

continueosly integrating the tools , continueosly deploying the applications, continueosly monitoring the applications through out entire 

its software developement life cycle.

===================================================================================================

Continueos Integration :

CI means continueosly developing the code , continueosly combining the code, so that we can fix the bugs as per the time line 
and also we can reduce the time during the release in your line.


Continueos Delivery: ( Manual approach)

It is nothing but what ever we generate the package into your environment. suppose If I want continueosly delivery into each and 
every environment. If we can do review and then we can deploy into the environment. 


continueos Deployment :( with out manual)

CD is peace of practice to design ensure the code can be rapidly or safely deployed into live environment production by delivering each 
and every change in the production.


Devops workflow / Jenkins work flow :

1. code commit (github)

2. Build ( maven)(war / ear / jar )

3. code quality ( Sonarqube --->> critical / major / blocker )

4. release package (war / ear / jar )

5. uploading package into Nexus ( Artifactory)

6. deployment ( tomcat ) ---->> dev/qa/uat/prod

7. Test
